# GP16_WasteManagement
Hackathon project â€” Waste Management + AI

Group16
SDG: Responsible Consumption and Production

Idea: An AI-powered waste classification system that identifies the type of waste (plastic, metal, paper, organic, etc.) from images and provides recycling or disposal advice.

Solution: 
- Build a Python-based Streamlit web app where users upload an image of waste 
- The AI model (trained with transfer learning) classifies it  
- The app suggests the correct disposal/recycling method.

Key Features:
Image Upload & Classification: Users can upload waste images.
AI Prediction: Deep learning model predicts the waste category.
Recycling Advice: Shows disposal/recycling guidelines for each class.
Interactive Demo: Real-time predictions in a simple web app.
Scalable: Future integration with smart bins or municipal apps.
